phptelemeter v0.26-pre2 - Copyright (c) 2005 - 2006 by Jan De Luyck

What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~
- phptelemeter is a script that can read the webpages for the
  webbased 'quota' monitor for the Belgian ISP 'Telenet'.
  These pages contain both the actual status,  and the status since
  the last 'reset', which happens on the date of your invoice. This
  is what makes up the used quota.
- Alternatively (and recommended) it can parse the Telemeter4Tools
  status pages, which are designed not to break on each update by
  Telenet ;)

What can it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This script was designed from the ground up to be usable both
  by humans and by machines. The output code can be in human-readable
  format, in a no-nonsense script parsable format or in HTML format.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- It requires PHP >= 4.3.0, and the PHP4 CURL extension, compiled with
  SSL support!
- For Telemeter4Tools it requires the nusoap SOAP library, and the xmlparser
  XML library. Both are included in the package.

Howto
~~~~~
- First off, to actually run this script you must tell it where the
  php binary is. Edit phptelemeter.php and modify the first line
  to #!/path/to/php4 -q. On Debian Sid, this is /usr/bin/php4.

- To create the initial configuration file, just run the script.
  It will notice the absence of ~/.phptelemeterrc, and create a
  dummy version. Next, configure this file (usually you'll just
  want to change username and password to the information for
  your account), and rerun phptelemeter - you'll get the output
  you want instantly.

  Alternatively, you can also run phptelemeter with --new-config, which
  will create a new dummy config file in your current directory.

Command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- There are several options (you can view them with --help):
  * --help - show help
  * --daily - show the 30day overview (overrides config)
  * --remaining - show the remaining quota (overrides config)
  * --debug - shows some debugging stuff
  * --file-output - sets the output to file mode instead of screen (stdout)
  	(overrides config)
  * --new-config - generates a new dummy config file on the spot
  When the --parser output is used, --remaining is automatically added to the
  output.

  When --debug is used, --file-output is automatically disabled.

Configuration file location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The configuration file is searched in two locations, in the following order
  (whichever is found first is used)
  * /etc/phptelemeterrc
  * ~/.phptelemeterrc
- If no configuration file is found, the script will try to create a dummy in
  ~/.phptelemeterrc.
